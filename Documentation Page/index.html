            <header>What is Brain Drain</header>
            <p>Brain drain refers to the emigration of highly trained or qualified individuals from their native country.</p>
            <p>It often involves the movement of educated individuals from developing to developed countries.</p>
            <p>The term can apply to sectors like healthcare, engineering, and information technology.</p>
            <code>&lt;!-- Example: A doctor moves from India to the USA for better opportunities. --&gt;</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Definition</li>
                <li>Scope</li>
                <li>Industries affected</li>

            <header>Causes of Brain Drain</header>
            <p>One major cause of brain drain is the pursuit of better career opportunities abroad.</p>
            <p>Higher salaries and improved living standards also attract talent away from home countries.</p>
            <p>Political instability and lack of research funding are additional factors.</p>
            <code>&lt;!-- Example: Salary differences in developing vs. developed countries. --&gt;</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Economic factors</li>
                <li>Political factors</li>
                <li>Social factors</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="Effects_on_Economy" class="main-section">
            <header>Effects on Economy</header>
            <p>Brain drain can lead to a shortage of skilled workers in the home country.</p>
            <p>It often results in reduced economic growth and innovation potential.</p>
            <p>Remittances from emigrants can provide some financial benefits, however.</p>
            <code>&lt;!-- Example: Impact on GDP due to loss of skilled labor. --&gt;</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced growth</li>
                <li>Lower productivity</li>
                <li>Remittance benefits</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="Impact_on_Society" class="main-section">
            <header>Impact on Society</header>
            <p>The social impact of brain drain includes the depletion of local knowledge and expertise.</p>
            <p>It can also create disparities in educational systems.</p>
            <p>Family separation is another significant social consequence.</p>
            <code>&lt;!-- Example: Loss of educators in home countries. --&gt;</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Loss of expertise</li>
                <li>Educational gaps</li>
                <li>Family impact</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="Possible_Solutions" class="main-section">
            <header>Possible Solutions</header>
            <p>Improving career opportunities and salaries in the home country is essential.</p>
            <p>Providing incentives for returning emigrants can also help reduce brain drain.</p>
            <p>Investing in education and infrastructure can attract and retain talent.</p>
            <code>&lt;!-- Example: Research grants for professionals in developing countries. --&gt;</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Economic incentives</li>
                <li>Policy reforms</li>
                <li>Educational investments</li>
            </ul>
